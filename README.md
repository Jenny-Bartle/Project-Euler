# Project-Euler
This is where I keep my solutions to Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net). It's also an android app because when I started writing it I had an android tablet and I thought I might as well learn something about app writing while I was at it. I wish I'd done them in python now!
When you click on a button it will calculate the answer to the corresponding PE question, and it will give you the answer and the time it took to calculate. 
Due to the fact that I had no idea how to write an app there are some quirky design decisions in this, notably the use of reflection to work out which Problem class to instantiate.
